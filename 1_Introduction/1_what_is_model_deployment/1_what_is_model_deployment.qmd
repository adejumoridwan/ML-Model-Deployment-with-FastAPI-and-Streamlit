## What is Model Deployment?

* Taking a trained machine learning model from development to production.
* Integrating it into applications, websites, or services.
* Enabling the model to interact with real-world data and make predictions.

## Why is it Important?

* Transforms theoretical insights into practical solutions.
* Delivers tangible business value through automation and data-driven decision making.
* Provides feedback for continuous model improvement through interaction with real-world data.

## Key Steps in Deployment:

* Model packaging and optimization.
* Infrastructure selection and configuration.
* Integration with existing systems and applications.
* Monitoring and performance evaluation.

## Model Deployment LifeCycle
