## Why Deploy Models?

Machine learning models aren't just for show - they're meant to be used in the real world. By deploying your model, you can make it accessible to users who can benefit from its insights and predictions. There are several reasons why you should deploy your model:

1. **User Interaction:**

Machine learning is not just about building complex models; it's about providing value to users. Deploying your model allows users to interact with your insights through user-friendly interfaces like APIs or web apps, making your work more accessible and impactful.

2. **Complex Applications:**

Some machine learning models are designed to be used in complex applications such as AI voice assistants, video recommendations, and weather forecasting. Deploying your model enables these applications to leverage their predictions and provide valuable services to users.

3. **Scalability and Efficiency:**

Deploying your model on a server or cloud platform ensures scalability and efficiency. This allows you to handle a large number of requests simultaneously, ensuring that your model can serve multiple users without compromising performance.

4. **Real-Time Predictions:**

By deploying your model, you can enable real-time predictions. This is crucial for applications that require immediate responses, such as fraud detection systems or stock trading platforms. Deploying your model allows it to make predictions on the fly, providing users with up-to-date insights.

5. **Continuous Improvement:**

Deploying your model is not a one-time task. It involves continuous monitoring and improvement. By tracking your model's performance in real-world scenarios, you can identify areas for improvement and make the necessary adjustments to enhance its accuracy and effectiveness.

As you work through this course, consisting of eight sections, you will gain a comprehensive understanding of model deployment, including best practices, different deployment methods, and considerations for various use cases.

 Each chapter is designed to achieve specific aims and objectives, equipping you with the knowledge and skills necessary to successfully deploy your machine learning models.

**Introduction**

In this section, you will delve into the concept of model deployment, exploring its significance and the diverse strategies employed in the process. We will provide a concise overview of FastAPI and Streamlit, shedding light on their distinct purposes and how they contribute to model deployment.

**Building APIs with FastAPI**

In this section, you'll grasp the essence of building APIs with FastAPI. We'll begin by delving into the basics of creating APIs using this powerful Python framework. You'll comprehend how to leverage Path and Query parameters effectively, along with their diverse validation techniques.

Next, we'll explore the concept of the request body, shedding light on how to craft APIs to receive form and file requests from clients. This will empower you to gather and process data from various sources seamlessly.

Moreover, we'll delve into the realm of templates and static files, equipping you with the skills to present your API's functionalities in a user-friendly and visually appealing manner.

Finally, we'll emphasize the significance of testing your API applications. We'll guide you through setting up a testing environment, writing comprehensive test cases, and implementing best practices to ensure the sustainability and maintainability of your APIs.

By the end of this section, you'll possess a solid understanding of building robust and scalable APIs using FastAPI. You'll be able to design, develop, and test your API applications with confidence, ensuring they meet the demands of the modern web.

**ML Models as an API with FastAPI**

You will learn how to use FastAPI to create ML model APIs by building a weather model forecast API. You will build a forecast model from scratch and use it for prediction on an API endpoint.

**Building Web Applications with Streamlit**

In this section, you will be introduced to the basic components of a Streamlit application, including inputs, widgets, and layouts. You will also learn about caching and session management, two important features for building high-performance web applications.

**Integrating FastAPI with Streamlit**

In this section, you will build the user interface for the weather forecasting model API built in the previous section and also integrate the API with Streamlit.

**Deployment**

This section will show you how to deploy your Model API and Streamlit application using Render and Streamlit Cloud.

**WhatsApp AI Text-to-Image Chatbot**

This project will show you how to use your existing FastAPI knowledge with external tools such as Vonage and DALL-E API to build a WhatsApp chatbot.

**Capstone Project**

You will showcase the skills you have learned in this course by building a full application that allows real estate agencies to predict house prices using various features.
